TODO

- it should be easy to include new jars for custom exercises

- mechanism for killing trainees

- mechanism for adding trainees  on the fly

- coaches need to write to unique filename so that multiple coaches can run in parallel (for testing).

- in the coach vm not much output is visible

- better location to store the heartattack files

- when a heart attack of one of the trainees is encountered..  something should be done.
    - Currently the test aborts.
    - Start the next workout.

- when response times for workers are too big: heart attack

- something should be done with the pid

- option to shutdown all trainees

- it should be possible to chain multiple workouts

- a heart attack should be connected to a particular exercise


DONE

- removal of the waiting mechanism; not needed.

- assistent coaches can't be reused at the moment.

- when a worker encounters an error, it should also produce a heart attack file.

- when a workout starts, the coaches should be cleaned first.

- option to fail immediately when a workout fails

- when a trainee process exits abnormally, a heart attack should happen

- setting to create a trainees per work out or to reuse them

- heart attack indicator; when a worker thread throws an exception, it should be posted on a central topic
that will be listened to by the master

- version needs to be logged by head coach

- version needs to be logged by assistant coach

- the content of the exercise is now printed.

- trainee needs to log into log dir.

- configuration of hazelcast.xml file for trainee client

- configuration of hazelcast.xml file for trainee

- changed the logging so it relies on hazelcast logging.

- when an exercise fails, it needs to be correctly cleaned (also the trainees need to be killed no matter what)

- problem; because the coach also starts a trainee-hz, it will participate as trainee. This is no good.
So instead of having a trainee hz on each coach, probably better to have a coach instance on each trainee.

- configuration of hazelcast.xml file for coach

- option to see the trainee logging within the coach

- trainee vm's need to write to a unique logfile (probably give them a different working directory)

- log configuration for trainee needs to be pulled out.

- log configuration for coach needs to be pulled out.

- a distribution of the heart attack tool

- loading workout: the file should be configurable

- loading workout: only mapworkout currently can be loaded.

- ability to configure the workouts. Currently it is hard coded.

- currently we can only do a single workout, but it should be possible to run a whole bunch of workouts.

- the number of machines started before running a workout is hard coded

- should be easy to split up the tearDown in 2 phases, one is a master setup and the other one is a shared setup.

- should be easy to split up the setup in 2 phases, one is a master setup and the other one is a shared setup.

- membercount/memberindex needs to be removed because we want to have a dynamic number of members

- be able to launch virtual machines from a coach

- the loggingthread needs to be cleaned up because it will never be ending.

- make use of a logging framework
