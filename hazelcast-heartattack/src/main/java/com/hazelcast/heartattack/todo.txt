TODO

- the manager should coordinate running of a workout, not the coach. This makes it easier to upload artifact
since each node will be treated equally

- it should be easy to include new jars for custom exercises. These jars should be uploaded by the manager
to the coaches.

- mechanism for killing trainees

- mechanism for adding trainees  on the fly

- something should be done with the pid

- when a coach is terminated (e.g. jvm crashes) the trainee vm's should terminate as well. Currently they keep running.

- better control on selecting the java virtual machine for the client

- currently the client is running in the directory of the jvm; which of course is no good.

- when an exception is thrown by one of the ExerciseInstance method, it isn't correctly translated to a heartattack (lots
of information missing).

- the manager should have more advanced configuration to connect to the coach cluster, currently it needs to be on the
same host.

NICE TO HAVE

- coaches need to write to unique filename so that multiple coaches can run in parallel (for testing).

- option to embed a coach within a 'headcoach'

- an option to send back some kind of progress report that periodically can be asked by the head coach about the status
of a running job.

- currently only second based time entry is possible; which is annoying if yuo want to run for a large times. So do something
with 10m or 2h.

- automatically clear the trainee directory option

- option to shutdown all trainees

- it should be possible to chain multiple workouts

- when a heart attack of one of the trainees is encountered..  something should be done.
    - Currently the test aborts.
    - Start the next workout.

- when response times for workers are too big: heart attack

DONE

- the manager needs to show time

- sending 'echo's should be done using a topic, not an executor. So the manager can participate as well

- the addresspicker issue that prevent creating large number of trainee vm's

- rename headcoach/assistentcoach.Probably assistent coach to coach and headcoach to manager

- the heart attacks should be published on a topic

- each coach needs to listen to the heart attack topic

- the 'headcoach' should only do coordination, not actual running

- trainee startup timeout should be configurable

- when a coach terminates, it should terminate the clients.

- when a heart attack happens, all coaches should see it.

- better location to store the heartattack files

- a heart attack should be connected to a particular exercise

- removal of the waiting mechanism; not needed.

- assistent coaches can't be reused at the moment.

- when a worker encounters an error, it should also produce a heart attack file.

- when a workout starts, the coaches should be cleaned first.

- option to fail immediately when a workout fails

- when a trainee process exits abnormally, a heart attack should happen

- setting to create a trainees per work out or to reuse them

- heart attack indicator; when a worker thread throws an exception, it should be posted on a central topic
that will be listened to by the master

- version needs to be logged by head coach

- version needs to be logged by assistant coach

- the content of the exercise is now printed.

- trainee needs to log into log dir.

- configuration of hazelcast.xml file for trainee client

- configuration of hazelcast.xml file for trainee

- changed the logging so it relies on hazelcast logging.

- when an exercise fails, it needs to be correctly cleaned (also the trainees need to be killed no matter what)

- problem; because the coach also starts a trainee-hz, it will participate as trainee. This is no good.
So instead of having a trainee hz on each coach, probably better to have a coach instance on each trainee.

- configuration of hazelcast.xml file for coach

- option to see the trainee logging within the coach

- trainee vm's need to write to a unique logfile (probably give them a different working directory)

- log configuration for trainee needs to be pulled out.

- log configuration for coach needs to be pulled out.

- a distribution of the heart attack tool

- loading workout: the file should be configurable

- loading workout: only mapworkout currently can be loaded.

- ability to configure the workouts. Currently it is hard coded.

- currently we can only do a single workout, but it should be possible to run a whole bunch of workouts.

- the number of machines started before running a workout is hard coded

- should be easy to split up the tearDown in 2 phases, one is a master setup and the other one is a shared setup.

- should be easy to split up the setup in 2 phases, one is a master setup and the other one is a shared setup.

- membercount/memberindex needs to be removed because we want to have a dynamic number of members

- be able to launch virtual machines from a coach

- the loggingthread needs to be cleaned up because it will never be ending.

- make use of a logging framework
