TODO

- heart attack indicator; when a worker thread throws an exception, it should be posted on a central topic
that will be listened to by the master and he will decide to kill

- coach needs to log into log dir.

- configuration of hazelcast.xml file for coach

- configuration of hazelcast.xml file for trainee

- mechanism for killing trainees

- mechanism for adding trainees

- problem; because the coach also starts a trainee-hz, it will participate as trainee. This is no good.
So instead of having a trainee hz on each coach, probably better to have a coach instance on each trainee.

DONE


- option to see the trainee logging within the coach

- trainee vm's need to write to a unique logfile (probably give them a different working directory)

- log configuration for trainee needs to be pulled out.

- log configuration for coach needs to be pulled out.

- a distribution of the heart attack tool

- loading workout: the file should be configurable

- loading workout: only mapworkout currently can be loaded.

- ability to configure the workouts. Currently it is hard coded.

- currently we can only do a single workout, but it should be possible to run a whole bunch of workouts.

- the number of machines started before running a workout is hard coded

- should be easy to split up the tearDown in 2 phases, one is a master setup and the other one is a shared setup.

- should be easy to split up the setup in 2 phases, one is a master setup and the other one is a shared setup.

- membercount/memberindex needs to be removed because we want to have a dynamic number of members

- be able to launch virtual machines from a coach

- the loggingthread needs to be cleaned up because it will never be ending.

- make use of a logging framework
