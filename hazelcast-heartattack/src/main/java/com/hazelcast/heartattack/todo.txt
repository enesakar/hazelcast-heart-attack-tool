TODO

- mechanism for killing trainees

- mechanism for adding trainees  on the fly

- something should be done with the pid

- when a coach is terminated (e.g. jvm crashes) the trainee vm's should terminate as well. Currently they keep running.

- better control on selecting the java virtual machine for the client

- makes it possible to send messages to the trainees; e..g increase load or something

- make it possible to also work with clients; currently each member will always be a member.. not a client

- make it possible to have multiple clusters

- make it possible for the exercise to raise a heart attack.

- exercise recipe needs to be send to the trainee

- the coach address needs to be send to the trainee

DONE


NICE TO HAVE

- currently there is no protection against multiple managers contacting the coaches.

- coaches need to write to unique filename so that multiple coaches can run in parallel (for testing).

- option to embed a coach within a 'headcoach'

- an option to send back some kind of progress report that periodically can be asked by the head coach about the status
of a running job.

- currently only second based time entry is possible; which is annoying if yuo want to run for a large times. So do something
with 10m or 2h.

- option to shutdown all trainees

- it should be possible to chain multiple workouts

- when a heart attack of one of the trainees is encountered..  something should be done.
    - Currently the test aborts.
    - Start the next workout.

- when response times for workers are too big: heart attack
