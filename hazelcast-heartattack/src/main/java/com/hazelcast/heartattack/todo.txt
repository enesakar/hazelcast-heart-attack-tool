TODO

- mechanism for killing trainees

- mechanism for adding trainees  on the fly

- something should be done with the pid

- when a coach is terminated (e.g. jvm crashes) the trainee vm's should terminate as well. Currently they keep running.

- better control on selecting the java virtual machine for the client

- currently the client is running in the directory of the jvm; which of course is no good.

- the manager should have more advanced configuration to connect to the coach cluster, currently it needs to be on the
same host.

- the trainee logs should be written in the trainee subdir for that specific workout

- traineeclasspath should not be only a dir, but also be a listing of jars/directories

- the trainee and coach should not communicate through the map the find the id/member information since I have the impression
that the map is broken. So probably better to use a file containing the member info,

DONE

- when an exception is thrown by one of the ExerciseInstance method, it isn't correctly translated to a heartattack (lots
of information missing).

- when exercise fails to start correctly, the system keeps running and causing exception

- the trainee heart attack file should be written in the trainee subdir

- it should be easy to include new jars for custom exercises. These jars should be uploaded by the manager
to the coaches.

- the manager should coordinate running of a workout, not the coach. This makes it easier to upload artifact
since each node will be treated equally

- copying of jars causes problem

- the exerciserecipe should have a multiline tostring for prettier logging

- replace the shitty json binding by properties

- the properties of the exerciserecipe need to be bound on the exercise

- rename exerciseinstance to exercise and exercise to exerciserecipe

- remove the 'exercisejunk' class. Bind directly on the ExerciseInstance

- automatically clear the trainee directory option

NICE TO HAVE

- coaches need to write to unique filename so that multiple coaches can run in parallel (for testing).

- option to embed a coach within a 'headcoach'

- an option to send back some kind of progress report that periodically can be asked by the head coach about the status
of a running job.

- currently only second based time entry is possible; which is annoying if yuo want to run for a large times. So do something
with 10m or 2h.

- option to shutdown all trainees

- it should be possible to chain multiple workouts

- when a heart attack of one of the trainees is encountered..  something should be done.
    - Currently the test aborts.
    - Start the next workout.

- when response times for workers are too big: heart attack
